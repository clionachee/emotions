## Usage


♥

Exchange Emotions offers a unique experience for users to engage with emotions and NFTs. Here's how you can use the platform:

1. **Emotion Input Interface**: Utilise the user-friendly interface in Unity to input your emotions, along with descriptions and personal stories. Express yourself fully by sharing the stories behind your emotions, creating a meaningful connection with others.

2. **Mint Emotion NFTs**: Exchange Emotions leverages the Flow blockchain SDK to create smart contracts that mint NFTs for each emotion input by users. These NFTs include valuable metadata about the emotion, the associated story, and other relevant information, making each NFT a unique digital expression of human emotions.

3. **Send Emotion NFTs**: Create an interface where users can explore and select emotion NFTs to send to others, fostering connections and spreading love. By sharing these NFTs, Exchange Emotions aims to create a world where emotions truly count, and where people can express their feelings permanently through digital art.

4. **Socialise in the Metaverse**: Dive into the metaverse within Exchange Emotions to meet people, connect on a deeper emotional level, and exchange emotions with others. Explore a virtual world where feelings are celebrated, and connections are strengthened.

5. **Exchange Emotions**: Beyond sending emotions, users can exchange NFT emotions with others, creating a community of empathy, understanding, and love. Each exchanged emotion becomes a symbol of the connections forged within the metaverse.

6. **Track Mental Health Progress**: Users can track their mental health progress on the blockchain, with significant milestones minted as NFTs. These visual representations of their emotional journey serve as powerful motivators and provide valuable data for personal growth and reflection.
